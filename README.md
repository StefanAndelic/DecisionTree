DecisionTree machine learning algorithm and its evaluation on an adjusted hepatitis data set taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

This repository implements the code for DecisionTree algorithm using Gini Impurity measure written in Java and it classifies each instance in the test set hepatitis-test.dat according to training set hepatitis-training.dat.

The code can be execured through CLI by entering the file name followed by designated training and test files (e.g. java -jar DecisionTree_Part1.jar hepatitis-training.dat hepatitis-test.dat). Alternatively, DecisionTree_Part1.jar file or the source code provided in the repository can be imported into a Java IDE (e.g. eclipse).
